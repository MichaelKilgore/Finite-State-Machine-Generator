# Finite-State-Machine-Generator

Synopsis:\
This program uses Python3 in a declarative style to generate C++ code for a finite state machine.\

Usage:\
You can use this program by running one of the sample programs, being either "./description.py" or "./description1.py". You can also mimmick these samples and create your own sample file. All of which should generate C++ code for a finite state machine.
