# Finite-State-Machine-Generator

Purpose:

This is a project for the University of Washington Bothell Scripting Course.

This program uses Python3 in a declarative style to generate C++ code for a finite state machine.

Usage:

You can use the fsm.py file to generate finite state machines in C++. For some examples on using the fsm generator you can run the example1.py and example2.py files which will generate C++ files that you can execute.
